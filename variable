1. Types of Variables in ML
(a) Based on Role

Independent Variables (Features / Predictors / Input variables)

These are the inputs used by the ML model.

Example: In predicting house prices, size, location, and number of rooms are independent variables.

Dependent Variable (Target / Output variable / Response variable)

This is the outcome we want to predict.

Example: House Price in the above case.

(b) Based on Data Type

Numerical Variables

Continuous: Can take any value in a range.
Example: Temperature = 22.5Â°C

Discrete: Takes fixed values, usually integers.
Example: Number of children = 3

Categorical Variables

Represent categories or labels.

Nominal: No order between categories. Example: Red, Blue, Green

Ordinal: Categories have order. Example: Small, Medium, Large

Binary Variables

Only two possible values.

Example: Yes/No, 0/1

Text Variables

Words, sentences, or documents used in NLP (Natural Language Processing).

Example: Customer reviews

Time Variables

Data that changes over time.

Example: Stock price on different dates

2. Why Variables Are Important in ML

Variables determine the patterns and relationships models learn.

Choosing the right variables (feature selection) improves model performance.

Wrong or irrelevant variables may lead to overfitting or underfitting.

3. Example

Suppose we are predicting student exam scores:

Hours_Studied	Sleep_Hours	Attendance	Score
5	7	90%	85
2	5	70%	50

Independent Variables: Hours_Studied, Sleep_Hours, Attendance

Dependent Variable: Score
